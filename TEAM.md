# Team — NGT-2.0 Project

## Founder & Architect
### **Maryan Bogdanov**
Creator of Flexion Dynamics V2.0 and the NGT-2.0 Structural Reserve Protocol.

#### Core Expertise
- Nonlinear dynamic systems  
- Structural stability and control theory  
- Economic system architecture  
- Deep risk models (Flexionization, FRE)  
- Protocol design and autonomous system mechanics  
- C++/Solidity/Rust development  
- Reserve engineering and reversible economic design  

#### Key Contributions
- Author of **Flexion Dynamics V2.0**  
- Author of **NGT-2.0 Whitepaper**  
- Creator of the **Flexionization Theory**  
- Designer of **FRE (Flexionization Risk Engine)**  
- Architect of **FCS (Flexionization Control System)**  
- Developer of high-stability nonlinear control SDKs  
- Experience with complex structural modeling and collapse prevention systems  

#### Mission
To create self-preserving, structurally correct economic systems  
that can survive indefinitely under any market regime —  
a new class of mathematically viable economic architecture.

## Additional Expertise (Advisory / Ecosystem)
While the project is currently led by a single architect,  
NGT-2.0 is designed to integrate:

- economic researchers  
- applied mathematicians  
- smart contract engineers  
- systems designers  
- treasury & DAO analysts  

as the protocol matures.

## Vision Statement
NGT-2.0 is built on a single foundational goal:

**To design an economic organism that does not decay.**  
A structurally viable system based not on heuristics  
but on formal geometry, contractivity, and viability boundaries.
