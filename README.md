# NGT — Next Generation Token 2.0
### Structural Reserve Protocol Based on Flexion Dynamics V2.0

NGT-2.0 is a next-generation economic protocol built on formal structural dynamics rather than market mechanisms.  
The system maintains a mathematically defined structural state:

X = (Δ, Φ, M, κ)

Where:
- Δ — structural deviation  
- Φ — structural energy  
- M — accumulated memory  
- κ — local contractivity  

NGT-2.0 preserves long-term viability by ensuring that X always remains inside the Viability Domain:

Φ ≤ Φ_max  
M ≤ M_max  
||Δ|| ≤ Δ_max  
κ ≥ 0

This forms a new class of self-preserving economic systems.

## 🧠 What Is NGT-2.0?

NGT-2.0 introduces:
- Structural Flow instead of market-driven logic  
- Reserve and Vault as structural components  
- Governance 2.0 (humans define boundaries, system executes autonomously)  
- EFM 2.0 — Emergency Flexion Mode  
- Contractivity guardian (κ ≥ 0)  
- Collapse Boundary — mathematically defined structural failure surface  

This transforms the protocol into a **structural organism**, not a speculative system.

## 🧩 Purpose of the Project

To create the first economic protocol capable of maintaining  
**structural life indefinitely**,  
regardless of market conditions.

NGT-2.0 replaces reactive, heuristic, and price-driven designs  
with formal structural geometry and contractive dynamics.
