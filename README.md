# NGT — Next Generation Token  
### Structurally Correct Economic System Based on Flexionization  
**Whitepaper v1.2**

NGT (Next Generation Token) represents a new class of economic systems:  
**structurally-correctable protocols**,  
where stability emerges from mathematical state dynamics rather than price control or market behavior.

The model is based on **Flexionization** — a formal system in which the state \( S \) is corrected through controlled deviation \( \Delta \):

\[
F : \Delta \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^+  
\]
\[
E : \mathbb{R}^+ \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^+  
\]
\[
F(S_{t+1}) = E(F(S_t))
\]

Unlike stablecoins, algorithmic models, or index-based mechanisms,  
NGT does **not** use price as a control variable.  
The system manages only **structure** — the asset pool, token circulation, and Vault mechanics.

## 🧠 Core Concept

NGT addresses a fundamental question:

> How can an economic system remain structurally correct  
> regardless of market volatility or external conditions?

The answer is **Flexionization**:  
a formal mechanism that corrects the system’s structure instead of trying to control its price.
