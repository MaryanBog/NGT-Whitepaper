# NGT-2.0 — Project Overview
### Structural Reserve Protocol Built on Flexion Dynamics V2.0

NGT-2.0 is the first economic protocol that maintains long-term structural viability through formal mathematical dynamics rather than market behavior, price control, or collateral mechanisms. The system operates inside a defined structural space using the state vector:

X = (Δ, Φ, M, κ)

Where:
- Δ — structural deviation  
- Φ — structural energy  
- M — accumulated memory  
- κ — local contractivity  

The protocol ensures X remains inside the Viability Domain D, defined by:
Φ ≤ Φ_max  
M ≤ M_max  
||Δ|| ≤ Δ_max  
κ ≥ 0  

These conditions form the foundation of NGT-2.0 as a self-preserving economic organism.

## Problem
Current economic protocols — stablecoins, treasuries, DAOs, indexes, and algorithmic stabilizers — all suffer from the same flaw:  
**they degrade structurally over time.**

They accumulate irreversible damage, lose reversibility, and break under stress because they lack a structural model of system life.

Even NGT 1.x had these limitations:
- one-dimensional deviation  
- no memory tracking  
- no energy metric  
- no contractivity geometry  
- no viability boundaries  
- no collapse detection  

As a result, real-world shocks eventually lead to structural failure.

## Solution
NGT-2.0 introduces a new category:  
**Structural Reserve Protocols.**

Instead of controlling price or managing collateral, the system manages *structure* using formal mathematics from Flexion Dynamics V2.0.

Key properties:
- Autonomous structural correction  
- Contractive geometry (κ ≥ 0)  
- Explicit collapse boundary  
- Reserve as a structural substrate  
- Vault as a reversibility buffer  
- Governance limited to boundary control  
- No heuristics or price-reactive mechanisms  

This allows the system to remain alive indefinitely under any market regime.

## Why Now
The Web3 ecosystem increasingly demands:
- stable treasury mechanisms  
- resilient DAO financial structures  
- advanced economic primitives  
- mathematically safe systems  

NGT-2.0 offers a new foundation for long-term, self-correcting economic design.

## What Has Been Built
- Full mathematical framework: Flexion Dynamics V2.0  
- NGT-2.0 whitepaper (EN)  
- Structural architecture: Reserve, Vault, Flow, Governance  
- Collapse boundary and viability domain formalization  
- Safety invariants and Flow projection model  
- Investor materials (Pitch Deck)  
- Documentation ecosystem  

---

## What the Grant Will Enable
Funding will support:
- engineering of the Structural Flow simulator  
- reference implementation (Solidity / Rust)  
- reserve and vault execution modules  
- contractivity safety engine (κ-guard)  
- tooling for structural metrics  
- open-source SDK for integrations  

This will create the first fully operational structural-economic protocol.

## Vision
NGT-2.0 establishes a new paradigm:  
**an economy that maintains its structural life indefinitely.**

Not driven by price.  
Not controlled by markets.  
Not dependent on heuristics.  
But guided by formal structural geometry.

NGT-2.0 transforms economic systems into self-preserving structures capable of long-term resilience.
