# NGT-2.0 — Security Model
### Structural Safety, Invariants, and Collapse Prevention

NGT-2.0 is designed as a mathematically safe economic protocol.  
Its security model is based not on heuristics or collateral thresholds,  
but on structural invariants derived from Flexion Dynamics V2.0.

Unlike traditional systems, NGT-2.0 prevents collapse through formal geometry.

## 1. Structural Safety Foundation

The protocol operates in a defined structural space:

X = (Δ, Φ, M, κ)

Security is enforced by ensuring the system never leaves the Viability Domain D:

Φ ≤ Φ_max  
M ≤ M_max  
||Δ|| ≤ Δ_max  
κ ≥ 0

Violation of these constraints leads to irreversible collapse.  
NGT-2.0 enforces them mathematically in every operation.

## 2. Collapse Boundary

The Collapse Boundary C defines structural death:

C = ∂D ∪ { κ < 0 }

Crossing C results in:
- divergent geometry
- runaway deviations
- irreversible memory formation
- loss of correction capability
- structural collapse

All execution paths strictly avoid C.

## 3. Contractivity Guard (κ ≥ 0)

κ is the core security metric.  
It determines whether the system is in a safe, convergent region.

Rules:
- No operation may reduce κ below zero
- High-stress operations are blocked as κ→0
- Flow projection removes any divergent components
- Vault takes priority when κ is fragile

This is the primary invariant preventing collapse acceleration.

---

## 4. Memory Bound (M ≤ M_max)

Memory represents irreversible damage.

Security rules:
- No operation may drastically increase M in fragile states
- EFM mode suppresses memory-heavy actions
- Reserve operations are replaced by soft Vault corrections when needed
- M_max is calibrated to structural reversibility

This prevents long-term degradation.

---

## 5. Energy Bound (Φ ≤ Φ_max)

Φ quantifies structural tension.

If Φ grows:
- the system becomes rigid
- corrective operations become dangerous
- κ collapses rapidly

NGT-2.0 reduces Φ through:
- Vault pressure absorption
- rotation suppression
- Δ-targeted corrections
- soft structural adjustments

Energy spikes are mathematically blocked.

---

## 6. Deviation Bound (||Δ|| ≤ Δ_max)

Δ represents multidimensional structural distortion.

Security enforcement:
- rotations respect Δ_max  
- circulation changes are restricted  
- asymmetry loops are blocked  
- EFM mode limits deviation-intensive operations

Δ never grows beyond safe operational reach.

---

## 7. Structural Flow Safety

The Structural Flow:

F_flow(X) = -∇Φ + R(X) - G_M(X) + Cκ(X)

is inherently safe because:
- it reduces Φ
- it corrects Δ
- it slows under high M
- it protects κ

Flow is projected into executable operations via π(F_flow).  
π removes any unsafe components that violate D.

This guarantees all system movement is contractive and reversible.

---

## 8. Vault Safety Role

Vault provides:
- reversibility buffer  
- energy reduction  
- memory suppression  
- κ protection  

When the system approaches collapse:
- Vault becomes dominant
- reserve adjustments are halted
- Δ corrections switch to soft mode

Vault prevents irreversible trajectories.

---

## 9. Governance 2.0 Safety

DAO cannot execute unsafe operations.

Governance controls only:
- Φ_max
- M_max
- Δ_max
- asset eligibility
- EFM thresholds

Governance cannot:
- override κ constraints
- force unsafe rotations
- modify structural physics
- execute reserve operations

Security is mathematical, not political.

---

## 10. Emergency Flexion Mode (EFM)

EFM activates when the system approaches collapse:

Triggers:
- Φ→Φ_max
- M→M_max
- ||Δ||→Δ_max
- κ→0

In EFM:
- amplitude is reduced
- Vault becomes primary
- memory-heavy paths disabled
- collapse geometry avoided

EFM guarantees last-line structural protection.

---

## 11. Security Summary

NGT-2.0 prevents collapse through enforceable structural invariants:

1. X(t) ∈ D at all times  
2. κ must remain ≥ 0  
3. No high-memory operations under stress  
4. Φ spikes are blocked  
5. Δ distortion is capped  
6. Vault protects fragile states  
7. Governance cannot break safety rules  
8. Flow projection ensures contractive movement  
9. Collapse Boundary C is never crossed  

These invariants form a mathematically rigid security model  
unlike anything in traditional crypto-economic systems.

NGT-2.0 is engineered not only to function,  
but to **stay structurally alive** under all conditions.
